# Binary-classifier-vs-Multi-class-classifier-Python-

- In this programming assignment we implement Logistic Regression using binary logistic regression classifier and multi-class logistic regression classifier to classify the handwritten digits. 
- We perform the same classification with SVM classifier provided by SK learn library, The SVM kernel is implemented with varying parameters of kernel, gamma values, C values. 
- We analyze the performance of SVM, Logistic Regression with Binary Classifier and Logistic Regression with Multi-class Classifier in terms of accuracy of the classification.
